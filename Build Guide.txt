This guide is only if you download KeyTik source code or clone it. Source code is for if you worry about virus and data safety or want only the source code.
This guide is to repeate build process if you want to build it from source code. I have included build download in release.
So if you download KeyTik and not KeyTik Source Code in the release, then you don't need to do this.

* Preparation (You can skip it if you already do this): 
   - Download and install Python in : https://www.python.org/downloads/.
   - After install open command prompt.
   - Copy command below and wait until process is done to install Pyinstaller.
     (pip install pyinstaller)
   - Move command prompt path to KeyTik Source Code path with below, command make sure to change the path.
     (cd path:/to/KeyTik/source/code)
     
* Building Commadn Using PyInstaller :
  - After all preparation done, copy below command and paste it to command prompt.
    (pyinstaller --onedir --noconsole --add-data "_internal/Data;_internal/Data" --icon="_internal/Data/icon.ico"KeyTik.py)
  - Wait until process done.
  - It should create folder and file like this (Build, KeyTik.spec, Dist)
  - Your KeyTik executeable file should be in the Dist including _internal folder.
  Note : You can discard Build and KeyTik.spec as that is only Pyinstaller build remain. 
  The actual important part is only in Dist which KeyTik executeable file and _internal (The necessary file to make executeable work).

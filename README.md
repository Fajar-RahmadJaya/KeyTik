# KeyTik: The All-in-One Automation Tool & Keyboard Remapper with Profiles
## GUI-Based Keyboard Remapper with Profiles, AutoHotkey Script Manager, Auto Clicker, Screen Clicker, and More.
KeyTik is an open-source automation tool that can do almost all automation at your will. At first, KeyTik focused on keyboard remapper with profile to activate or deactivate each remap individually. But because it also use AutoHotkey as scripting language to do the automation, it allow KeyTik to do all automation available by AutoHotkey such as auto clicker, keyboard remapper, screen clicker and more. 

With a bit of scripting you can do all of that with ease. If you don't have coding experience, don't worry because i also made a beginner friendly open-source AutoHotkey script collection and template that allow you to download already made script or edit it to your preference. I try to make it as easy to understand as possible with guide how to use the template or change the code in each script, make sure to visit it at [AutoHotkey Script Collection And Template](https://github.com/Fajar-RahmadJaya/AutoHotkeyCollection) if you are interested. 

So if you are looking for lightweight auto clicker, keyboard remapper, screen clicker and more or All-in-One Automation Tool and AutoHotkey script manager with user friendly GUI, then this is what you are looking for. I hope you can enjoy it and it can be useful to you. Sincerely, Fajar Rahmad Jaya.

## How To Install : 
To install KeyTik you just need to follow these step :
1. **Download And Install AutoHotkey**
    - AutoHotkey Download Website : https://www.autohotkey.com/download/.
    - If you encounter any issues with AutoHotkey installation, Visit AutoHotkey install documentation at : https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/howto/Install.htm.
2. **(Optional) If You Use Assign Profile On Specific Device Feature, You Need To Download And Install Interception Driver First**
    - Interception Driver Download : https://github.com/oblitum/Interception/releases
    - To install, visit [AutoHotkey Interception, Install the Intereception driver](https://github.com/evilC/AutoHotInterception?tab=readme-ov-file#install-the-intereception-driver) for detailed install guide.
    - To know whether the Interception Driver is correctly installed or not, Try using "Open AHI Monitor To Test Device" button. If it's work, then the Interception Driver is installed correctly.
4. **Download KeyTik from one of the following platforms**
    - KeyTik GitHub Release : https://github.com/Fajar-RahmadJaya/KeyTik/releases.
     - There are 2 option to download, normal version and source code version.
     - If you want simple version in executable form, you can download the normal version (In release it's the zip file without 'open source version' name on it, example KeyTik.v1.3.rar). In normal version you can directly double click the exe file to run KeyTik.
     - If you want the raw code only, you can download source code version (In release it's the zip file with 'open source version' name on it, example KeyTik.v1.3.Source.Code.Download.Version.rar). To make it work, you need to install required python library or build it into executable yourself. I have added guide to build it into the download or you can see it in [here](https://github.com/Fajar-RahmadJaya/KeyTik/blob/main/Build%20Guide.txt).
    - Source Forge : https://sourceforge.net/projects/keytik.

## How To Use KeyTik Automation Tool :
Automation tools come bundled as one with KeyTik download. It count as profile in text mode, so all of it can use KeyTik feature. I take it from my side project on [AutoHotkey Script Collection And Template](https://github.com/Fajar-RahmadJaya/AutoHotkeyCollection). I add comment on the script to make it easier to change. So if there are ";" on the line in script that mean after it or ";" right is comment and what you can change is before it or left ";". Example : '''space:: ; This is comment'''. On that example 'space' is what you can change and '; this is comment' is the comment. Comment mean AutoHotkey not detect it as input which mean comment is not affecting script.

### Auto Clicker:
Auto Clicker default is to simulate 'left click' when holding 'e' key with 100 millisecond interval. You can adjust it to your preference  like change the 'e' key, change left click and change interval. For more guide on how to adjust or download the script, go to AutoHotkey Script Collection And Template release on [Auto Clicker When Holding Specific Key](https://github.com/Fajar-RahmadJaya/AutoHotkeyCollection/releases/tag/AutoClickHoldingKey).

### Screen Clicker :
Screen clicker work with It work with simulate 'left click' on specific screen coordinate. You can change coordinate and interval to your preference. Don't worry because KeyTik also comes with tool to find screen coordinate then it will automatically copy. 

### Screen Coordinate Auto Detect And Copy :
To make screen clicker editing easier. I also include coordinate detector to KeyTik. On default, you just need to move your cursor to desired position then press 'space'. After that, it will show coordinate and automatically copy it. You can then just paste whenever you want. You can also change 'space' part to you preference.

### Multiple Files Opener :
You can open multiple files only with one key or more. In default, it use alt + left to open some files or program. You can change files path with your files or programs path to your preference. Make sure you change files path to yours because in default it only give you path example not the actual path. For more guide on how to adjust or download the script, go to AutoHotkey Script Collection And Template release on [Shortcut To Open Multiple Files](https://github.com/Fajar-RahmadJaya/AutoHotkeyCollection/releases/tag/ShortcutOpenFiles).

## What You Can Do With KeyTik :
**1. Multiple profile :**
* When you need multiple condition to activate remap like for different game or you need to remap some key for only one condition and don't need to always activate it, you can make different profile as you need and activate or deactivate individually so you don't need to adjust your remap every single time you need it for another condition.
  
**2. Always on top :**
* When you playing game and that game didn't have change input function, you can make KeyTik window to always on top using "Enable Always On Top" button, so you can play the game, try the game input and change the input in KeyTik or try the remap profile on that game without go back and forth between game window and KeyTik window.
  
**3. Store Profile :**
* If you don't want to show profile in the main window but you still need it or you just want to store it for future, you can store the profile using "Store" button. If you happen want to run it, you can use "Show Stored Profile" and it will show your stored profile an if you want to show it back in main window, you can use "Retrieve" button to move it back to main window.
  
**4. Run On Startup :**
* If you have damaged key on your keyboard and want to remap it permanently (You can still disable it so it's not entirely permanent) without activate it manually every single time you open your computer, you can use "Startup" button to make profile run on startup. If you do that, your profile will active every single time you open your computer. You can disable it using "Unstart" or disable it in task manager startup apps.
  
**5. Text Mode :**
* Text mode is for more advance remapping. KeyTik using AutoHotkey as profile automation script language and text mode allow you to edit your script without opening  script editor. You can use this when you need to adjust your script or use it for automation like auto clicking etc. The reason for this feature is, so that you can use full potential of AutoHotkey and not limited to just remapping some key.
  
**6. Import Profile :**
* You can add AutoHotkey script from outside, like download script from someone or from some platform and use it as profile. It work with adding another command in your imported script so it can use functionality from KeyTik. I also made an open-source repository for AutoHotkey Script Collection and template that allow you to download already made AutoHotkey script. AutoHotkey Script Collection and template also give you guide on how to adjust the script to your preferences or using the script as script template. Click this "[AutoHotkey Script Collection](https://github.com/Fajar-RahmadJaya/AutoHotkeyCollection)" if you are interested.
  
**7. Pin Profile :**
* You can pin your favorite profile or profile that you use the most so it can showed first in the profile list. You just need to click pin icon on the profile to make it work.

**8. Assign Script On Specific Device :**
* You can connect 2 keyboard on your device. You can use first keyboard to typing normally and the other one to do automation tool such as auto clicker, screen clicker, multiple files opener and more, on each key and that would not affect the first keyboard. So you are left with 2 keyboard connected, 1 can do normal keyboard task and the other one can do automation tool. Even more, if you assign the automation to more compact keyboard such as mini keyboard so each key in that keyboard can do different automation tool, that will make it more neat and flexible.

**9. And Many More :**
* Above is just an example how you can use each feature. It's absolutely possible to use it for different need and case. There are a lot of possibility you can discover with KeyTik. Let us know if you are discovering another use of KeyTik on our [GitHub discussion page](https://github.com/Fajar-RahmadJaya/KeyTik/discussions).

## User Safety (For Those Who Worry About Virus Or Data Safety) :
I don't make this software for that reason and this software is open source, so you can rest assured. If you still have doubt, you can try [Virus Total](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload) to scan it. Virus Total is known for it being a free online service that analyzes files and URLs for viruses, malware, and other malicious content by scanning them with a wide range of antivirus engines and security tools. The scan is done each version release to ensure safety in each version. The conclusion is, i don't intend to add virus or take your personal data intentionally or without your permission. I want to build trust with you so you can use KeyTik without worry. 

But if you still have some doubt, i also include non built version on release. With it you can check the source code yourself. You can also build it yourself, i also include buld guide on the download or you can check it [here](https://github.com/Fajar-RahmadJaya/KeyTik/blob/main/Build%20Guide.txt). So there are 2 download version in each release starting from version 1.2. They are normal and source code version. Normal version is download version which i build it myself using the same code as in source code version so you don't have to. I use python library [Pyinstaller](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller) to built it. 
The source code version is download version that not builded, in other word it's the raw code. People usually prefer this version to made sure there isn't anything suspicious because if it's source code they can check it themself. You typically can't do this if it's in executable format because usually executable contain binary which make it difficult to check. 

But at the end at least for KeyTik, what i build and what you build yourself is the same if you use the same technique and command like me using Pyinstaller because i build the normal version using the same code in the source code version. To make it work, you need to install the required python library or build it yourself into executable. So if you don't want an extra step then, normal version is what you need. If you want only the source code or have no problem with extra step, then source code version is what you need.

Again, i don't intend to add malware on KeyTik so don't be afraid to download the normal version which i build myself using the same code in source code version. Here is my scan on KeyTik v1.2 using virus Total if you have doubt (You can also scan for yourself if you want 100% certain) :

* Report Screenshots :
<img src="Preview/Virus Total Report v1.3.png" alt="Virus Total Report v1.3" width="500" />

* Full scan report :

> [!TIP]
> **I don't add the normal download version is because i just realize whatever i do pyinstaller build will always detected as malware. But the source code version itself is not detected as malware. If you are curious or still worried, try to download source code version then build it yourself and try to rescan. Even if you build it yourself the result will be the same. It will still detected as malware as long as we build it using pyinstaller. Don't worry, it's false positive.**

> **This is completely normal so you don't have to worry.**

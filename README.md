## What Make Us Different Then Other Remapper :
* KeyTik is using AutoHotkey as remapper so basically it has all autohotkey feature as remapper.
* Various functinality that can help remapping easier.
* You can activate or deactivate profile individually so you don't need to adjust remap every single time.
* Run profile on startup so you can activate profile everytime you open the computer without needed to activate manually.
* Always on top functionality so you can create or edit profile on top of any window.
* And more.

## Features :
1. Create Remap Profile.
2. Run & Exit Remap Profile.
3. Delete & Store Remap Profile.
4. Edit Remap Profile.
5. Make Window Always On Top.
6. Run Profile On Startup.
7. Show Stored Profile.

## Example How You Can Use It :
1. Multiple profile :
* When you need multiple condition to activate remap like remap keys for different game or you have one key for multiple remap key, you can make different profile as you need and activate or deactivate individually so you don't need to adjust your remap every single time you need it for another condition.
2. Always on top :
* When you playing game and that game didn't have change input function, you can make KeyTik window to always on top using "Enable Always On Top" button, so you can play the game and know what key need to remap so you don't have to change back and forth between window.
3. Store Profile :
* If you don't want to show profile in the main window but you still need it or you just want to store it for future, you can store the profile using "Store" button. If you happen want to run it, you can use "Show Stored Profile" and it will show your stored profile or you want to show it back in main window, you can use "Retreive" button to move it to main window.
4. Run On Startup :
* If you have damaged key on your keyboard and want to remap it permanently (You can still disable it so it's not entirely permanent) without activate it manually every single time you open your computer, you can use "Startup" to make profile run on startup. If you do that, your profile will active every single time you open your computer. You can disable it using "Unstart" or disable it in task manager startup apps.
5. And more.

## User Safety (For Those Who Worry About Virus Or Data Safety) :
I don't make this software for that reason and this spftware is open sorce, so you can rest assured. If you still have doubt, you can try virustotal to scan it. Virustotas is known for it being a free online service that analyzes files and URLs for viruses, malware, and other malicious content by scanning them with a wide range of antivirus engines and security tools you can check it in (https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload). Here is my scan using virustotal (You can also scan for yourself if you want 100% certain) :

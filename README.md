# KeyTik: The All-in-One Automation Tool & Keyboard Remapper with Profiles
## GUI-Based Keyboard Remapper with Profiles, Auto Clicker, AutoHotkey Manager, and More.
KeyTik is an open-source automation tool that can do almost all automation at your will. At first, KeyTik focused on keyboard remapper with profile to activate or deactivate each remap individually. But because it also use AutoHotkey as scripting language to do the automation, it allow KeyTik to do all automation available by AutoHotkey such as auto clicker, keyboard remapper, screen clicker and more. 

With a bit of scripting you can do all of that with ease. If you don't have coding experience, don't worry because i also made a beginner friendly open-source AutoHotkey script collection and template that allow you to download already made script or edit it to your preference. I try to make it as easy to understand as possible with guide how to use the template or change the code in each script, make sure to visit it at [AutoHotkey Script Collection And Template](https://github.com/Fajar-RahmadJaya/AutoHotkeyCollection) if you are interested. 

So if you are looking for lightweight auto clicker, keyboard remapper, screen clicker and more or All-in-One Automation Tool and AutoHotkey script manager with user friendly GUI, then this is what you are looking for. I hope you can enjoy it and it can be useful to you. Sincerely, Fajar Rahmad Jaya.

## Example How You Can Use Each Feature :
**1. Multiple profile :**
* When you need multiple condition to activate remap like for different game or you need to remap some key for only one condition and don't need to always activate it, you can make different profile as you need and activate or deactivate individually so you don't need to adjust your remap every single time you need it for another condition.
  
**2. Always on top :**
* When you playing game and that game didn't have change input function, you can make KeyTik window to always on top using "Enable Always On Top" button, so you can play the game, try the game input and change the input in KeyTik or try the remap profile on that game without go back and forth between game window and KeyTik window.
  
**3. Store Profile :**
* If you don't want to show profile in the main window but you still need it or you just want to store it for future, you can store the profile using "Store" button. If you happen want to run it, you can use "Show Stored Profile" and it will show your stored profile an if you want to show it back in main window, you can use "Retrieve" button to move it back to main window.
  
**4. Run On Startup :**
* If you have damaged key on your keyboard and want to remap it permanently (You can still disable it so it's not entirely permanent) without activate it manually every single time you open your computer, you can use "Startup" button to make profile run on startup. If you do that, your profile will active every single time you open your computer. You can disable it using "Unstart" or disable it in task manager startup apps.
  
**5. Text Mode :**
* Text mode is for more advance remapping. KeyTik using AutoHotkey as profile automation script language and text mode allow you to edit your script without opening  script editor. You can use this when you need to adjust your script or use it for automation like auto clicking etc. The reason for this feature is, so that you can use full potential of AutoHotkey and not limited to just remapping some key.
  
**6. Import Profile :**
* You can add AutoHotkey script from outside, like download script from someone or from some platform and use it as profile. It work with adding another command in your imported script so it can use functionality from KeyTik. I also made an open-source repository for AutoHotkey Script Collection and template that allow you to download already made AutoHotkey script. AutoHotkey Script Collection and template also give you guide on how to adjust the script to your preferences or using the script as script template. Click this "[AutoHotkey Script Collection](https://github.com/Fajar-RahmadJaya/AutoHotkeyCollection)" if you are interested.
  
**7. Auto Clicker :**
* With a bit of scripting, you can add many automation tool to your preferences such as auto clicker. As for how to do it refer to [How To Use KeyTik as Another Automation](https://github.com/Fajar-RahmadJaya/KeyTik?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-use-auto-clicker-) or scroll above.
  
**8. Screen Clicker :**
* Still at work, look forward to it!!
  
**9. Multiple Files Opener Using Shortcut :**
* Still at work, look forward to it!!
  
**10. Pin Profile :**
* You can pin your favorite profile or profile that you use the most so it can showed first in the profile list. You just need to click pin icon on the profile to make it work.
  
**11. And many more.**

## How To Use KeyTik As Auto Clicker :
Auto clicker come bundled as one whenever you download KeyTik. I take it from [AutoHotkey Script Collection And Template](https://github.com/Fajar-RahmadJaya/AutoHotkeyCollection) so the default it use hold 'e' to activate auto clicker. So whenever you hold the 'e' key on you keyboard, it will simulate left click infinitely with 100 millisecond between each left click. You can adjust it like change the 'e' key, change left click, change interval. For more guide on how to change it or download the script, go to [Auto Clicker When Holding Specific Key](https://github.com/Fajar-RahmadJaya/AutoHotkeyCollection/releases/tag/AutoClickHoldingKey).

## User Safety (For Those Who Worry About Virus Or Data Safety) :
I don't make this software for that reason and this software is open source, so you can rest assured. If you still have doubt, you can try [Virus Total](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload) to scan it. Virus Total is known for it being a free online service that analyzes files and URLs for viruses, malware, and other malicious content by scanning them with a wide range of antivirus engines and security tools. The scan is done each version release but maybe it will take time for me to update it. The conclusion is, i don't intend to add virus or take your personal data intentionally or without your permission. I want to build trust for KeyTik user so they can use KeyTik without worry. Here is my scan using virus Total if you have doubt (You can also scan for yourself if you want 100% certain) :

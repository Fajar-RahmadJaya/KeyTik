# KeyTik: The All-in-One Automation Tool & Keyboard Remapper with Profiles
## GUI-Based Keyboard Remapper with Profiles, Auto Clicker, AutoHotkey Manager, and More.
KeyTik is an open-source automation tool that can do almost all automaton at your will. At first, KeyTik focused on keyboard remapper with profile to activate or deactivate each remap individually. But because it also use AutoHotkey as scripting language to do the automaton, it allow KeyTik to do all automation available by AutoHotkey such as auto clicker, keyboard remapper, screen clicker and more. 

With a bit of scripting you can do all of that at ease. If you don't have coding experience, don't worry because i also made a beginner friendly open-source AutoHotkey script collection and template that allow you to use already made script or change it to your preference. I try to make it as easy to understand as possible with guide how to use the template or change the code per script, make sure to visit it at [AutoHotkey Script Collection And Template](https://github.com/Fajar-RahmadJaya/AutoHotkeyCollection). So if you are looking for all-in-one automation with user friendly GUI, then this is what you are looking for. I hope you can enjoy it and it can be useful to you. Sincerely, Fajar Rahmad Jaya.

## How To Use KeyTik as Another Automaton : 
I made another repository to store AutoHotkey script collection. I plan to made it to be as neat and beginner friendly as possible. It also include a script for automaton so you can download it then import it to KeyTik. As it first created, it still didn't has many script but i will try to add more usefull script or you can contribute to it because its open-source. Click this "[AutoHotkey Script Collection And Template](https://github.com/Fajar-RahmadJaya/AutoHotkeyCollection)" if you are interested. If you want to use the automaton below, just click on it and you will directed to AutoHotkey collction repository download and guide.
1. [AutoClicker](https://github.com/Fajar-RahmadJaya/AutoHotkeyCollection/releases/tag/AutoClickHoldingKey).
2. Screen Clicker (Not Yet Added).
3. And Many More.

## Example How You Can Use Each Feature :
1. Multiple profile :
* When you need multiple condition to activate remap like remap keys for different game or you have one key for multiple remap key, you can make different profile as you need and activate or deactivate individually so you don't need to adjust your remap every single time you need it for another condition.
2. Always on top :
* When you playing game and that game didn't have change input function, you can make KeyTik window to always on top using "Enable Always On Top" button, so you can play the game and know what key need to remap so you don't have to change back and forth between window.
3. Store Profile :
* If you don't want to show profile in the main window but you still need it or you just want to store it for future, you can store the profile using "Store" button. If you happen want to run it, you can use "Show Stored Profile" and it will show your stored profile or you want to show it back in main window, you can use "Retrieve" button to move it to main window.
4. Run On Startup :
* If you have damaged key on your keyboard and want to remap it permanently (You can still disable it so it's not entirely permanent) without activate it manually every single time you open your computer, you can use "Startup" to make profile run on startup. If you do that, your profile will active every single time you open your computer. You can disable it using "Unstart" or disable it in task manager startup apps.
5. Text Mode :
* Text mode is for more advance remapping. KeyTik using AutoHotkey as remapper and text mode allow you to use AutoHotkey scripting that need more then just remap some key.
You can use this when you need to add condition to your remapping like capslock need to be active for the script to run or use it for automaton like auto clicking etc. The reason for this feature is so that you can use full potential of AutoHotkey and not limited to just remapping some key.
6. Import Profile :
* You can add AutoHotkey script from outside like download it from someone or from some website and use it as profile. It work with adding another command in script so it can use functionality from KeyTik. We also made a open-source repository for AutoHotkey Script Collection so you can download script and import to KeyTik. Click this "[AutoHotkey Script Collection](https://github.com/Fajar-RahmadJaya/AutoHotkeyCollection)" if you are interested.
7. Multiple Automation Tool:
* With a bit of scripting, you can add many automation tool to your preferences. As for how to do it refer to [How To Use KeyTik as Another Automaton]{https://github.com/Fajar-RahmadJaya/KeyTik?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-use-keytik-as-another-automaton-), click it or scroll above.
8. And many more.

## User Safety (For Those Who Worry About Virus Or Data Safety) :
I don't make this software for that reason and this software is open source, so you can rest assured. If you still have doubt, you can try [virustotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload) to scan it. Virustotal is known for it being a free online service that analyzes files and URLs for viruses, malware, and other malicious content by scanning them with a wide range of antivirus engines and security tools you can check it in. The conclusion is, i don't intend to add virus or take your personal data intentionally or without your permission, so you can rest assured. Here is my scan using virustotal (You can also scan for yourself if you want 100% certain) :

## Feature Plan (Possibly to be Implemented) :
1. Helper to Know What Remap Key in Profile.
2. Pin Profile.
3. Assign shortcut on profile.
4. Create profile or edit only always on top.
5. Repository or another way for opensource AutoHotkey script sharing and download, so you can share your script and download someone script
   then import it to keytik.

## Next Release Feature Plan :
1. Assign Shortcut.
2. Add Auto Clicker, Screen Clicer, Open Files In The Download.
3. Add Automatic Key Tracker.
4. Using Python Script To Use Profile.
Note : I will work on it after i finished adding point 2 in AutoHotkey Script Collection And Template Repository.

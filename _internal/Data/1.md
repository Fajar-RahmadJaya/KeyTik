**My Plan for the Pro Version**
<br>
- Additional UI for file openers.
<br>
- Additional UI for auto clicker.
<br>
- Additional UI for screen clicker.
<br>
- Full macro. Combining auto clicker, screen clicker, keyboard remap, files opener, in a single profile.
<br>
- Possibly AI integration.

<br>
- **Upcoming KeyTik update will be implemented on KeyTik Pro first**. **Including**:
<br>
* Instead of "Add Another Row" or "Add Shortcut Row" button to add key mapping or shortcuts, use + instead on separator between mapping.
<br>
* New automation tool, make specific program window always on top.
<br>
* New automation tool, OCR translator. Much like snipping tool but it will translate the chosen screen.
<br>
* Macro recording. Record any input and simulate it.


**Why You Choose Pro Version**
<br>
- Support the developer.
<br>
- More feature than the regular version.
<br>
